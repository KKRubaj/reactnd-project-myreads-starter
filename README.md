# MyReads Project

This is a simple 'Book Tracking Application' written in React as part of FEND nanodegree program. Main page cotains three shelves "Currently Reading", "Want to Read" and "Read" and button to add new books. This button takes us to Search page where we can find new books according to each character written and take it to our library on the right shelf. We can remove any book from any shelf.
